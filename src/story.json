Tim was no ordinary resident of Veggieville; he was, in fact, a human fruit.Born from the enchanted orchards on the outskirts of town, Tim was a remarkable blend of human and fruit, with skin the color of a ripe peach and hair as green as Granny Smith apples. He had always been a source of wonder and curiosity for the townsfolk.",
